    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",

    "#### 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "**Ans:** A function is procedure to achieve a particular result. It acts as a blueprint only. while function call is using this function to achive that task. Using a function to do a particular task any point in program is called as function call. "
